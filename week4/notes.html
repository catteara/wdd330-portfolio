    <p>Chapter 8: Forms</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Form Controls- Common Types</li>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;input&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;select&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;text area&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;button&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Input Fields</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Most common types of form control</li>
            <li>Type: &lsquo;text&rsquo;, &lsquo;password&rsquo;, &lsquo;checkbox&rsquo;, &lsquo;radio&rsquo;,
                &lsquo;hidden&rsquo;, &lsquo;file&rsquo;, &lsquo;number&rsquo;, &lsquo;tel&rsquo;, &lsquo;color&rsquo;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Text Areas</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines (example: a comment or blog post)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Button Types&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Submit</li>
            <li>Reset (Not Recomended)</li>
            <li>Button</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Form Validation</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Checks if user entered information correctly</li>
            <li>Types of Validations that occur ensure that:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Required field is complete</li>
                <li>Email address is valid</li>
                <li>Number is entered where numerical data is required</li>
                <li>Password is at least a minimum number of characters</li>
            </ul>
            <li>JavaScript validation should only be used to enhance user experience, use more validation on server side
                before data is saved to database.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>Chapter 12: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods.</li>
        <li>OOP</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Three Main Concepts:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Encapsulation- The inner workings that are kept hidden and only the essential functionalities are
                    exposed to the user.</li>
                <li>Polymorphism- The same process can be used for different objects. This means, various objects can
                    share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific
                    implementation (This sounds similar to CSS Specificity)</li>
                <li>Inheritance- Taking an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods and
                    then improving on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Constructor Functions</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A function that defines the properties and methods of an object</li>
            <li>Uses keyword this to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function.</li>
            <li>Built-In Constructor Functions Include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Object</li>
                <li>Array</li>
                <li>Function</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Constructor Property</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns the constructor function that created it</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Prototypal Inheritance</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Any properties or methods of a class&rsquo;s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by
                that class.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Polymorphism&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Different objects can have the same method but implements it in different ways</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Property Attributes and Descriptors</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Value, writable, enumerator, and configurable</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mixins</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using
                inheritance.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Allows more complex objects to be created</li>
            <li>Note to self: look more into this topic, at another resource (also, look into this and that more).</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Chapter 15: Section on Modular JavaScript</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can be used in other
            files and by other modules.</li>
        <li>Helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files. This makes the code more maintainable.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The code in each module should have a single purpose and group together for more distinct
            functionality.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Coupling</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Refers to how dependent certain elements or modules of code are on each other</li>
            <li>Two pieces of code are tightly coupled if they rely on each other to run and if changes are made to one
                it is likely the other will need changes as well</li>
            <li>Loosely coupled if one piece of code can be easily substituted without affecting the final outcome</li>
        </ul>
        <li>ES6 Modules&nbsp;</li>
        <ul>
            <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to
                opt out of this.</li>
            <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be
                accessed within that module.</li>
            <li>The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined, rather than the global object.</li>
            <li>You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program
                these days)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
