<!--We started the coding assignment in our meeting, but the code was never shared with me, so mine will be heavily based on the kind of confusing solution files. I wish I was more confident on what I was supposed to do for this assignment.-->

    <p>We started the project as a group on Wednesday, but the "main driver" never sent me what we had worked on so far. I tried to remember what we had done, as well as try to do it with help from the solution code, but I couldn't get it to work properly. The instructions this week felt very vague, and the solution has so many files (and the names are not consistent with the second one, made it very hard to try and follow). On the brightside, when everything is showing up, the CSS looks great.</p>
    <main>
      <h1>Great hikes</h1>
      <ul id="hikes" class="hikeStyles"></ul>
    </main>

    <script src="hiking-start.js"></script>
